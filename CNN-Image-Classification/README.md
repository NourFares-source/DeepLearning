Goal: Classify low-resolution color images into 10 distinct categories (animals and vehicles).

Architecture: Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) featuring three Conv2D layers for spatial feature extraction and MaxPooling2D for downsampling.

Performance: Achieved ~76% training accuracy and ~71% validation accuracy, demonstrating the model's ability to generalize to unseen images.

Key Learnings: Understanding the 3D structure of RGB image data, the importance of "Softmax" for multi-class probability, and why Convolutional layers outperform Dense layers in computer vision tasks.
